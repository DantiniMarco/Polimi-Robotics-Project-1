## ROS parameters 

### Service reconfigurable parameters
- __x:__ used to set the x coordinate of the odometry
- __y:__ used to set the y coordinate of the odometry
- __theta:__ used to set the theta coordinate of the odometry

### Dynamically reconfigurable parameters
- __EULER:__ used to set the current integration method to Euler
- __RUNGE-KUTTA:__ used to set the current integration method to Runge-Kutta


## Structure of the TF tree //is this the correct one?
- After have run the file bag1.bag, we visualized the structure of the TF tree thanks to the following command:

```
rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```
- Thus, we obtained the following:

## Structure of custom messages 

### odom.msg
- __nav_msgs/Odometry odom:__ odometry published in terms of orientation (with the quaternion <x,y,z,w>)
	and position (with the tuple <x,y,z>)
- __std_msgs/String method:__ method of integration currently used (Euler or Runge-Kutta)

### record.msg
- __header:__ contains informations about timestamp and sequence ID of the publication
- __pose_x:__ x coordinate recorded on the \_/robot/pose\_ topic
- __pose_y:__ y coordinate recorded on the \_/robot/pose\_ topic
- __pose_theta:__ theta coordinate computed after have been recorded the orientation in the \_/robot/pose\_ topic
- __w1:__ velocity of the front left wheel recorded in the \_/wheel_states\_ topic
- __w2:__ velocity of the front right wheel recorded in the \_/wheel_states\_ topic
- __w3:__ velocity of the rear left wheel recorded in the \_/wheel_states\_ topic
- __w4:__ velocity of the rear left wheel recorded in the \_/wheel_states\_ topic

### wheels_rpm.msg
- __header:__ contains informations about timestamp and sequence ID of the publication
- __rpm_fl:__ velocity of the front left wheel (computed from robot velocities) expressed in revolutions per minute
- __rpm_fr:__ velocity of the right left wheel (computed from robot velocities) expressed in revolutions per minute
- __rpm_rr:__ velocity of the rear right wheel (computed from robot velocities) expressed in revolutions per minute
- __rpm_rl:__ velocity of the rear left wheel (computed from robot velocities) expressed in revolutions per minute

### set_odometry.srv //Have we to put also this between custom messages?
- __x:__ x coordinate to be set by the service \_/set_odometry\_
- __y:__ y coordinate to be set by the service \_/set_odometry\_
- __theta:__ theta coordinate to be set by the service \_/set_odometry\_

## How to start nodes
- To start all the nodes is necessary to open a terminal and type the following command:

```
roslaunch odometry_project odometry.launch
```

## How to configure parameters //dunno if keep dynamic config info or not
- After the nodes have been launched it is possible to configure ROS parameters.
- To configure the parameters <x,y,theta> through a service open a terminal and type the following command:

```
rosservice call /set_odometry (new_x) (new_y) (new_theta)
```
__NB:__ one has to replace (new_x),(new_y) and (new_theta) with the values he wants to set for the odometry

- One way to configure dynamic parameters is to open a terminal and type:

```
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```
__NB:__ after that a new window will be opened and the user can dynamically configure the integration method 

## Further informations
- Publications on the topics are performed periodically thanks to a timer
- We decided to use revolutions per minute (instead of radians per minute) as unit measure for wheel velocities computed from robot velocities (vx, vy and rotational speed omega)
- As we noticed some recurrent dependencies in the formulas between the robot parameters (i.e., 1/(l + w) and r/(4 x gear_ratio)), we decided to calibrate at first these two new parameters by multiple iterations on certain ranges and then calibrate r and w keeping T and l fixed
