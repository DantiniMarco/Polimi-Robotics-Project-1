## ROS parameters

### Service

Used to change the __x, y, theta__ coordinates of the robot odometry at runtime. In order to set the <x, y, theta> coordinates via a service, type the following command:

```
rosservice call /set_odometry <new_x> <new_y> <new_theta>
```

Where *new_x*, *new_y* and *new_theta* are the new odometry pose values to be assigned

### Dynamically reconfigurable parameters

Used to set the integration method for the odometry computation to __EULER or RUNGE-KUTTA__ approximation methods. After the nodes have been launched, it is possible to configure this ROS parameter. Dynamic reconfiguration can be done by typing:

```
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
```

Then a window will be opened and the user can select the integration method.

## Structure of the TF tree

After have run the file bag1.bag, we visualized the structure of the TF tree thanks to the following command:

```
rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```

Thus, we obtained the following:

## Structure of custom messages

### `odom.msg`

- __nav_msgs/Odometry odom:__ odometry published in terms of orientation (with the quaternion <x,y,z,w>)  and position (with the tuple <x,y,z>)
- __std_msgs/String method:__ method of approximation used for the odometry computation (Euler or Runge-Kutta)

### `record.msg`

- __header:__ contains the timestamps and sequence IDs
- __pose_x:__ x coordinate retrieved from the */robot/pose* topic
- __pose_y:__ y coordinate retrieved from the */robot/pose* topic
- __pose_theta:__ theta coordinate (expressed as euler coordinate) computed from the orientation present in the */robot/pose* topic (expressed as a quaternion)
- __ticks1:__ ticks position of the front left wheel recorded in the */wheel_states* topic
- __ticks2:__ ticks position of the front right wheel recorded in the */wheel_states* topic
- __ticks3:__ ticks position of the rear left wheel recorded in the */wheel_states* topic
- __ticks4:__ ticks position of the rear right wheel recorded in the */wheel_states* topic

### `wheels_rpm.msg`

- __header:__ contains the timestamps and sequence IDs
- __rpm_fl:__ velocity of the front left wheel
- __rpm_fr:__ velocity of the front right wheel
- __rpm_rl:__ velocity of the rear left wheel
- __rpm_rr:__ velocity of the rear right wheel

Each velocity is computed from the robot relative velocities, and are expressed in revolutions per minute.

### `set_odometry.srv`

- __x:__ x coordinate to be set by the */set_odometry* service
- __y:__ y coordinate to be set by the */set_odometry* service
- __theta:__ theta coordinate to be set by the */set_odometry* service

## How to start nodes

In order to start all the nodes type the following command:

```
roslaunch odometry_project odometry.launch
```

## Images folder

The parameters were previously optimized as they were independent, and we also created a few plots to show the error value as function of the various parameter values which we simulated. So in the images folder there are still those plots. Then we changed the structure in order to optimize the values using the ticks positions and we didn't assume anymore that the values were independent with respect to each other. With this way it is not possible anymore to create nice looking 2d or 3d plots of the error function, since it depends from multiple variables.
